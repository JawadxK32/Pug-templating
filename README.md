# Pug-templating
A informational website developed using Pug templating to create the html pages on Node.js/express http server. 

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

To run locally, first install node_modules then run startapp.js
